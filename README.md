# Bitcoin-ABC

## What is Bitcoin-ABC

It is a version of Bitcoin Core, but with following small changes:

* Project development is not public (which ensures that secrets keep secret)
* The development group is much smaller: ABC < 10 developers vs > 100 Core developers. This guarantees that the most important players, the miners, can guarantee a bitcoin version, which gives them the most profit - independent if it's healthy for the bitcoin network.
* The code is not tested (which makes development much faster, yeah!)
* The code is not reviewed (test driven development is always the best. Bitcoin is still small, so small outages don't affect many people)

... TBD
