# Reasons why big block solution like Segwit2x are generally garbage:


* Bandwidth problems
  * [Video by RichardHeartWin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2941&v=iFJ2MZ3KciQ)
* Storage and other resource problems
  * [Slush's twitter thread](https://twitter.com/slushcz/status/895537494049030146)
* Has no consensus
  * [ALL core developers are against it](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segwit_support)
  * [Sybil resistant poll on coinbase shows big opposition](https://luke.dashjr.org/programs/kycpoll/answers.php)
* Is rushed (3 months is absolutely not enough)
* Implements no replay protection by purpose (which will lead to losses for many untechy people)
* Ignores peer review
  * [ALL core developers are against it](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Segwit_support)
* Codebase is outdated
* Will lead to more centralization
  * [See the Cornell study](http://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/CDE+16.pdf)
* Is not community driven but by some (strange) companies
* Contentious forks lead weakens both chains
  * [Can lead to chain hopping](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/731.pdf)
* Other scaling solutions scale much much better, increase decentralization again and have much lower fees 
  * Lightning network
  * MAST signatures
  * Schnorr
