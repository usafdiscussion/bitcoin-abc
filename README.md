* Bandwidth problems

* Storage and other resource problems
  * [Slush's twitter thread](https://twitter.com/slushcz/status/895537494049030146)
* SPV Nodes are no solution
  * [Could SPV Support a Billion Bitcoin Users?](https://www.coindesk.com/spv-support-billion-bitcoin-users-sizing-scaling-claim/)
* Will lead to more centralization
  * [See the Cornell study](http://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/CDE+16.pdf)
* Other scaling solutions scale much much better, increase decentralization again and have much lower fees
